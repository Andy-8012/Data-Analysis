# Overview

{Important!  Do not say in this section that this is college assignment.  Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

The database that I decided to reasearch was found on Kaggle.com. [Baseball Databank](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/open-source-sports/baseball-databank) I chose this data bank because I have always liked baseball. It has a lot of different stats from years 1871 all the way to 2015.

I wanted to see what the average ranks were for the teams with the highest salaries for their team and the teams with the player with the most hits on their team. All of this information can be found in this databank.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the data set, the questions and answers, the code running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Data Analysis Results

What is the average rank of the team who has the highest Salary?
The average rank is 2.29

What is the average rank of the team who has the player with the most hits in a season?

# Future Work

* Make it more customizeable to any data set that is being used
* Add a GUI to allow the user to controll what needs to be done
