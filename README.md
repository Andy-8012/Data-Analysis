# Overview

My goal with project is to learn more about databases and how you can use python to analyze different types of data.

The database that I decided to reasearch was found on Kaggle.com. [Baseball Databank](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/open-source-sports/baseball-databank) I chose this data bank because I have always liked baseball. It has a lot of different stats from years 1871 all the way to 2015.

I wanted to see what the average ranks were for the teams with the highest salaries for their team and the teams with the player with the most hits on their team. All of this information can be found in this databank.\

# Data Analysis Results

What is the average rank of the team who has the highest Salary?
The average rank is 2.29

What is the average rank of the team who has the player with the most hits in a season?
The average rank is 2.87

# Development Environment
The tools that I used for this software were:
- VS code
- Python Language
- Pandas libraries
- Python Debugger
- CSV files
- Kaggle database

* [Pandas 10 minute tutorial](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/10min.html#min)


# Future Work

* Make it more customizeable to any data set that is being used
* Add a GUI to allow the user to controll what needs to be done
